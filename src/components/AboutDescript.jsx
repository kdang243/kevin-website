        <div className="text-base verytiny:text-xl font-semibold mx-4 mb-4 ml-32 mr-16"> Hi! Thanks for checking out my website. My name is Kevin Dang, I am self-driven developer from Vietnam but I've lived in Canada for the past 10 years. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2024. My aim in development is to engineer impactful products efficiently and precisely and making the small things stand out.</div>
        <div className="text-base verytiny:text-xl font-semibold mx-4 mb-4 ml-32 mr-16">Outside of software development, I love basketball (GO RAPS, Kawhi should've stayed), making Vietnamese food and gaming. </div>
        <div className="text-base verytiny:text-xl font-semibold mx-4 mb-12 ml-32 mr-16">I am currently seeking new-grad oppurtunities! Whether it's in SWE, SDET, DevOps, or a combination, I am mostly here to absord and learn new things!</div>
